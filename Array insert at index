#Insertion is a basic but frequently used operation. Arrays in most languages cannnot be dynamically shrinked or expanded. Here, we will work with such arrays and try to insert an element at some index.
class Solution{
  public:
    // You need to insert the given element at the given index. 
    // After inserting the elements at index, elements
    // from index onward should be shifted one position ahead
    // You may assume that the array already has sizeOfArray - 1
    // elements.
    void insertAtIndex(int arr[], int sizeOfArray, int index, int element)
    {
        //Your code here
        
        
    }
};
